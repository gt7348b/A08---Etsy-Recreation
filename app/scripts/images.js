I am a work at home mom who decided to explore my passion for designing children&#39;s clothes. lil threadz has blossomed into a hobby turned business which allows me to balance my family and work from home.  I can still make homemade meals, go to playdates and kiss boo-boos in between responding to customer emails,cutting fabrics and sewing special birthday shirts :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you enjoy my shop :)",
"policy_payment": "Once an item has been purchased, please pay for your item through Paypal. If payment is not received within 48 hours and other arrangements have not been made, I will relist the item.

"policy_shipping": "Each shirt is made to order and 100% handmade by lil threadz.  We try to complete and ship each order within 7-10 business days (extra time during holidays) of confirmed payment to the address provided, sometimes sooner. \r\n\r\n**If you need a shirt asap, we do offer rush processing/shipping options. \r\nWe offer 2 different rush options. Both options guarantee the item will be completed and shipped out within 24-48 business hours (not counting weekend or holidays) from time of purchase.\r\n\r\nThe first one is an additional $10. The order would ship via Priority which is typically 2-3 but not guaranteed day delivery.  If you decide to go with this option you can simply add the shirt listing itself along with this link to your cart \r\nwww.etsy.com/listing/115241824/rush-service-for-your-lil-threadz-order?\r\n\r\nThe other option is sent via Express mail which is guaranteed 1-2 day delivery. This option is $25 and you can add this listing to your cart \r\nwww.etsy.com/listing/123030089/super-rush-service-for-your-lil-threadz?r...\r\n\r\nIf a package is shipped to the address provided and it is not the correct address, I am not responsible for the undeliverable package. If the undeliverable package is returned to me I will resend the shipment at customer&#39;s expense ($2.95).   \r\n\r\nCustom orders where fabric needs to be stocked typically take a bit longer to complete and ship, usually up to 5 business days and in rare instances as much as 10.  If I need more time to create your items I will contact you. \r\n\r\n♥DOMESTIC (US) SHIPPING:\r\nI ship via USPS First Class.  This does not include insurance towards loss and damage. If you require insurance, please contact me BEFORE placing your order. I do use delivery confirmation on all orders.  I also offer USPS Priority shipping for $5.95.  Please contact shop if you prefer to ship Priority.\r\n*I always obtain Delivery Confirmation for each shipment, I cannot, therefore, be held responsible for items lost in the mail.  I also provide each customer with the delivery confirmation number to allow the item to be tracked.  If you do not receive your package within one week of receiving your shipping confirmation please let me know and I will do my best to assist in obtaining information on its whereabouts.  \r\n*If I commit to shipping an item by a certain date, I most certainly will.  However, once I ship an item it is out of my hands.  I cannot be held responsible for items that do not arrive on a specified date when shipping via USPS First Class mail.  If you would like to guarantee shipping by a specific date please contact me to set up a different shipping option.\r\n\r\n♥INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS: \r\nAll international packages are sent via First Class Mail International airmail to the address provided in the order details.  There is no way to track delivery and it does not include insurance for losses/damages during shipment. We cannot provide a delivery date or guarantee receipt by a specific date for international packages when shipping via first class mail. If you would like a more secure shipping option like Fedex please contact shop for rates but they are considerably more.  If there are any Customs/Duties fees, they are the responsibility of the buyer.  We are not responsible for tariffs, taxes etc assessed by the country the item is being shipped to. \r\n\r\nI will combine items in order to conserve packaging materials (unless you specify otherwise).  All receipts are viewable and printable on Etsy so I do not include them in the package.  \r\n",

If an item is being returned/exchanged due to a lil threadz error we will provide a prepaid return label for you to send back the shirt.  All return/exchange items must be unworn and unwashed. No exceptions.\r\n\r\nReturns/Exchanges are not accepted on custom orders.

You may specify the tulle color and train length from our drop down menu upon purchase. If you don&#39;t see the color you are looking for just email me and I will be happy to add it to the options. \r\n\r\nTrain is made using a satin ribbon design. They measure in width approximately 11&quot; across and length is custom made to your specifications. Each strand of tulle is hand tied tightly for the fullness and poof shown in our model photos. Train is quadruple layered for fullness. Each end of the train features satin ribbons that will weave through the stretch crochet found on tutu dresses and ties a bow on each side. This allows the train to be easily removed for dancing and twirling after the wedding photos. They are also gorgeous in birthday photography. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* A very special thank you to our model Chloe and Amber Urey Photography for such GORGEOUS photos of our gown~\r\n\r\nwww.Facebook.com/LindisCustomDesigns\r\n\r\n~ Lindi",

Due to our custom and handmade boutique philosophy, all sales are final. Please be sure to measure carefully and contact us if you have any questions about how to measure. Most of our designs utilize tulle fabric which is a netting that is sheer. We always recommend wearing slips, boy short or dance/cheer briefs, leggings, or tights underneath for additional coverage.

Our items are one of a kind and unique in every way, and everything is handmade by Lindi!

"policy_payment": "Payment is now accepted via Etsy direct checkout and Paypal only. Our shop does accept Etsy giftcards!",
"policy_shipping": "For most items, I use USPS priority mail for my domestic shipping. Smaller items under 13 ounces will be shipped via first class postal service. For larger gowns or ensembles, I will also utilize UPS ground and Fedex ground services or for those heavier items that need larger boxes to help prevent wrinkling. Estimated shipping time for ground service is 5 - 7 business days once item has shipped. Contact me prior to purchase to discuss shipping options if needed such as expedited 1-2 day services.\r\n\r\nShipping fees for both U.S. domestic and international locations do not include insurance. If you prefer to purchase insurance on your items, please email me PRIOR to purchase so I can include the price on your order. Most clients do not, therefore the listings do not reflect insurance fees in the quoted shipping prices.\r\n\r\nLindi&#39;s has a rush fee for items that need to be made and shipped in under 2 weeks. This fee does NOT include expedited shipping. It is purely an administrative design fee for Lindi to create your items before or after normal working hours to expedite your order. If you then choose to upgrade the shipping method, you will need to contact me for a shipping quote depending upon your preferred method of delivery. Our rush fee is an additional $25.\r\n\r\nOnce your item ships, you will receive an Etsy generated email with the tracking number. \r\n\r\nFor international buyers: The quoted shipping fee on each listing does not include any additional taxes, surcharges, custom or duty fees associated with international trading and will be the buyers responsibility upon receipt. If you choose or decide to not pay your country&#39;s fees and decline acceptance of the item you purchased, you will NOT receive a refund for anything returned. We offer tracking numbers on every single item we ship and provide Etsy with the information proving the item was shipped and left the United States as contracted. We will be happy to re-ship your item if returned but client is responsible for the re-ship fee internationally. NO REFUNDS.",
"policy_refunds": "All sales are final due to the nature of costume/pageant/party/wedding ensembles. Each outfit is handmade by custom measurements provided by each client. Please be sure to measure carefully and message me if you have any questions prior to purchasing. We want you to be completely happy with your purchase but please contact us prior to ordering to discuss any measuring concerns. Returns and exchanges are not accepted. We put lots of time and love in each handmade item we make for each princess. Thank you for understanding!",

"title": "William Cahill / 1950s Wedding Dress / Mad Men Wedding / Wedding Dress Train / Traditional Wedding / Lace Wedding Dress / Long Sleeve",
"description": "William Cahill / 1950s Wedding Dress / Vintage Wedding / Mad Men / Train Circle / Wedding Gown / Traditional / Long Sleeve / White\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere Comes THE Bride.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m betting that little girls who dressed their dolls up and had weddings, dreamed of a wedding dress like this vintage 1950s beauty from legendary bridal designer William Cahill. This mid century gown is so dreamy and divine...from its floral appliques to its nipped in waist to its real sleeve buttons that actually button to its circle train (that circle train just had me think of the bride in the photographers studio and getting the circle just perfect for the portrait). My photos do not begin to do the dress justice. It is a small size and in Very Good Condition (please see below for full condition). This dress is perfect for vintage lovers, brides who want a traditional dress, a girl who wants to look like a lovely, romantic vision and those who want a bridal couture gown without the hefty price tag. Here&#39;s your gown. \r\n\r\nIf you were going to the Chapel in the 1940s through the 1960s, and you wanted the best in a bridal wear, chances are high that a wedding gown from William Cahill was your choice. The designer was also a favorite of &#39;Wedding Wear&#39; magazine for three decades. Cahill gowns are highly sought after by brides-to-be and collectors alike, because of Cahill&#39;s superior construction, and beautiful fabric. William Cahill wedding gowns are truly pieces of art. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory/Backstory: A Vintage Virginia Find.\r\n\r\nCondition: Very Good to Excellent. (I&#39;m a very harsh grader.) The dress is fully lined. This dress is MAGNIFICENT. It is constructed with the finest materials and with the best craftsmanship. There are a few flaws, but really to be expected, since the dress is 45+ years. The dress could walk down the aisle tomorrow  without even going to a specialist cleaner. (I would recommend a specialist cleaning though.) No yellowing (only slightly under the underarms, worse under the left arm.) Please see Photo 5. The third pic on the top shows a mark that is on the right front of the dress just below where the lace bodice hits the skirt. Small brown dot (1/4&quot;) on right sleeve. The flaws in no way detract from the overall appearance or utter FABULOUSNESS of the dress. I have taken this into account when pricing the dress. Please convo if you would like additional photos. \r\n\r\n\r\nLabel: William Cahill California\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterial: No material label. The bodice has floral lace appliques. The skirt is a taffeta like material.\r\n\r\n\r\nCare: Caution Dry Clean Only. Dangerously Flammable if Washed. \r\n\r\nSize: No Size. It is small. Please refer to the measurements listed and compare to your own body measurements as well as to the measurements of your own well-fitting dress.)\r\n\r\nMeasurements:\r\n\r\n(All measurements are taken with the garment lying flat and all buttons buttoned, zippers zipped....you get the idea. Measurements are doubled where appropriate, i.e. for bust, waist, hips. Measurements are in inches. I still haven&#39;t mastered the metric system.) Please note that clothes are usually pinned for the best fit on the skinny minny mannequin and dress form.\r\n\r\nLength (from shoulder/neckline to hem): 59&quot; (front) 84&quot; (back, the train) \r\n\r\nTrain Width (Across): 80&quot;\r\n\r\nBust (armpit to armpit): 32&quot;\r\n\r\nWaist: 26&quot;\r\n\r\nHips: 36&quot; (free) \r\n\r\nSleeve (from shoulder to cuff): 26&#39;\r\n\r\nSleeve Width: 6&quot; (widest, top) 4&quot; (cuff)\r\n\r\n\r\nColors: Wedding White.\r\n\r\n\r\nPackaging: The dress will be carefully packaged and shipped via USPS Priority Mail. \r\n\r\n\r\nPlease convo if you prefer a different shipment method, like Parcel Post.\r\n\r\nI love to combine shipping and I always refund postage overages.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmoke free home.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for taking the time to look.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s another Wonderful Wedding Dress:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/120208089/gunne-sax-dress-wedding-dress-1980s\r\n\r\n&\r\n\r\nHere are more Divine Dresses:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/TheThriftingMagpie?section_id=11036413\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or would like more photos, please do not hesitate to convo me.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about me:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/people/TheThriftingMagpie?ref=si_pr#\r\n\r\nTo learn about The Thrifting Magpie&#39;s policies, including layaway:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/your/shops/TheThriftingMagpie/policies\r\n\r\n♥Tracey",

Any overpayments on shipping will be refunded via PayPal.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING:\r\n\r\nIf you prefer a different shipping method (FedEx, UPS, etc.) rather than USPS Priority Mail,  please convo me before making your purchase so I can see what the shipping price will be with the alternate shipper and make any necessary adjustments to the quoted shipping price.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\n\r\nI ship most packages via USPS Priority Mail. I find it is one of the safest and most reliable ways. Packages can be tracked. It can be expensive. I am always happy to ship First Class International if the item(s) are under the weight and size restrictions: \r\n4 pounds (1.81 kilos ) and a combined height, length and width of 36 inches (91.44 centimeters).\r\n\r\nFor some listings I have quoted the shipping for First Class International. Please convo if you would prefer Priority Mail or another shipping service.\r\n\r\n Any custom charges/tariffs are the sole responsibility of the buyer. Also, please check with your country&#39;s import laws to make sure that your purchase is not on the banned list. For example, some countries do not allow used leather products. That means no leather bags, shoes, belts, etc. from The Thrifting Magpie.  \r\n\r\nAnd the final note, I cannot be held responsible if the package is held in customs for a prolonged period of time.

Payment-in-full must be received by the final date, unless prior agreed upon terms have been arranged. In the case that payment-in-full is not received by the final payment date, buyer forfeits the layaway item and the initial 20% deposit. Any monies paid surpassing the initial 20% will be refunded back to the buyer via PayPal.\r\n\r\nI sell vintage, designer, collectible and decorative items. Vintage by its nature means that the item has had a former life with someone else. It has been pre-owned, and pre-loved, to varying degrees. Vintage means not perfect. \r\n\r\n I am well versed and knowledgeable about many areas of vintage, designer, collectible and decorative items. However, I am not an expert on everything. I learn something new everyday. I believe in selling only authentic items. I hate wanna-be&#39;s. No fakes here. \r\n\r\nAll of this said, I am human and humans make mistakes. In the case that I have made a mistake, and for example, something I believed and researched to be authentic, i.e. a genuine designer vintage bag, is proven not to be authentic, I will happily refund all monies, including postage. \r\n\r\nPlease buy with confidence. I have been dealing with vintage/designer/collectibles  for over a decade, and really, the passion has been there my whole life. I buy from trusted sellers. If I have any questions of authenticity, I go to a trusted authenticator or straight to the original source, i.e. Louis Vuitton if it&#39;s a vintage Speedy.",

"digital_sale_message": "Generic Info on Printing\r\n\r\nhttp://apartystudio.wordpress.com/2011/08/24/party-decoration-costs-and-printing-issues/\r\n\r\nI do highly recommend getting everything printed on a laserjet printer because the quality is exceptional. If you don’t have a laserjet printer at home then no worries you can head to your local print/copy center. My local Office Depot only charges 69 cents a sheet for color prints on card stock (59 cents if I take in my own cardstock) before tax. If you go that route, then they have computers in their print/copy center so you can pull up all the files I e-mail you there (just log onto your yahoo/gmail/hotmail/etc account and download on their computer).  That way, you don&#39;t have to deal with saving everything on to a CD or thumb drive. Let me know if you have any questions about printing. \r\n\r\nThat being said, you can certainly print these on your home printer even if it is an inkjet.\r\n\r\nMake sure if you use a print/copy center (or print at home) that you specify that they do not alter the size and that the quality is set to high. I recently used UPS and when I saw the print outs, I thought the colors were not as vibrant as they should have been and sure enough, when I got home and compared to what I&#39;d printed out from Office Depot (in the same colors/party collection), the colors were not as strong. I didn&#39;t even think to ask them about the quality. I just assumed it&#39;d be on high so remember to mention that whenever you get prints done at a copy/print center. \r\n\r\nPlease contact me via e-mail if you have any questions at all. apartystudio@gmail.com\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nTali \r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apartystudio.etsy.com\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/apartystudio\r\nhttp://pinterest.com/apartystudio/\r\nhttps://twitter.com/apartystudio \r\n\r\n",
