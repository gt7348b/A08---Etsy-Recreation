My pieces are hand-cut and, therefore, can often take a substantial amount of time to produce depending on the design.  \r\n\r\nFAQ&#39;s\r\n \r\nMost of my toppers are made from my delicious, homemade vanilla buttercream marshmallow fondant or Satin Ice brand fondant for darker shades that are difficult to achieve using coloring gels such as red, black and dark brown.  Decorations should be stored in an air-tight container or the shipping box, on a shelf or in a cabinet away from heat and moisture. DO NOT place your toppers in the refrigerator or freezer as condensation will soften them.

"title": "You left Paw Prints in My  Heart -Custom Personalized Cat, Dog, Pet Photo Keepsake Christmas Ornament / Urn Medallion. Laser-engraved Wood.",
"description": "This pet memorial keepsake ornament is an awesome way to commemorate the life of your beloved fur baby. Fully custom, this ornament is a perfect way to remember any critter with paws who has earned your love. Perfect for your kitty cat, puppy dog, hamster, ferret, bunny rabbit, rat, mouse, gerbil, chinchilla, sugar glider squirrel, or raccoon!\r\n\r\nTopped off with a red ribbon, this laser-engraved wood ornament is a substantial 3/16” thick and is designed to last a lifetime. I have not finished it, but it&#39;s ready for staining if you so desire. \r\n\r\nThis would make a great gift for anyone who&#39;s been fortunate enough to share the life of an extraordinary pooch.\r\n\r\nPERSONALIZATION OPTIONS\r\n(I need this information before I can start on your ornament)\r\n \r\nMemorial Phrase:\r\nDefault: You left paw prints in my heart\r\nOption 1: Waiting at the Rainbow Bridge\r\nOption2 : Your own text, up to 35 charracters\r\n\r\nName: Up to 10 characters works best, but I can make others work\r\n\r\nYears of birth & passing\r\n\r\nPhoto: Important - the better quality photo you can give me, the better your ornament will look. Photos in natural light that are taken with high resolution (300 dpi at 3x 5 inches) are best, but I can work with many photos. Good quality photos are especially important for a good result with mostly black animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther (Ornament / Medallion)\r\nDefault: Approximately 4” x 3 /12” with a 1/4” hole at the top. 3/16” thick.\r\nOption 1: Remove holes to turn into a keepsake medallion (for example, to glue on the front of flat sided pet urn)\r\nOption 2: Remove ornament hole and make smaller. $5 extra processing fee applies.\r\nOption 3: Remove holes and enlarge medallion. Quote available upon request. (I pre-cut all of my wood stock for easy processing, so ordering something larger will require a trip to the store.)\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN COLOR and SOME WOOD ODOR IS TO BE EXPECTED:\r\nThese are engraved on plywood made of very thin veneers. I set the laser power to remove 1-3 layers of wood to enhance the beauty and depth or your keepsake. Each piece of plywood is unique, and no ornament will look exactly like those pictured.\r\n\r\nThe laser-engraving process leaves behind a earthy burnt wood smell that dissipates with time. This is normal and to be expected. This can be mitigated with a layer of shellac if you are so inclined.\r\n\r\nWHEN TO EXPECT YOUR ORDER\r\nI ship 4-5 times per month. I process incoming artwork all week and run the laser engraver on Saturdays only. CUT OFF FOR PROCESSING IS NOON C.S.T. ON FRIDAY.\r\n\r\nIf payment and complete personalization information are received prior to Friday at noon, your order will ship the following Monday. Your order is not considered “received” until I have all the necessary information from you to complete your order. If your information is received after Friday at 12:01 p.m.(Central Standard), your order will not be processed until the following Saturday.\r\n\r\nRUSH PROCESSING AVAILABLE\r\nIf you need your item right away, I will process and mail it within 1 business day for a $20 Rush Fee.",

"description": "The Camargue White Horses live in a wild region in South East France.\r\n\r\nIn this image I wanted to capture a sense of pure speed, as this horse galloped close by my side, the water and mud spraying in every direction, covering both me and my camera, but gifting me this extraordinary moment, which evokes a clear memory in me of the magic every time I see it. Being splattered with mud by a Camargue Horse, pretty much heaven in my world, even a blessing! I hope this brings to you a sense of the power, speed, life and beauty of that moment.\r\n\r\nThis is a photographic print from an edition of 20 at this size.\r\nThe print is on A5 photo pro paper with a a small white border as illustrated.\r\nPaper size is 8 1/4 x 5 7/8 ins / 210 x148 mm\r\nPrint size is 7 1/2 x 4 7/8 ins / 193 x 123 mm\r\nImages are printed on Canon semi-gloss paper with Chromalife 100+ inks, for pure depth of colour and long life.\r\n\r\nI print all my photographs myself, as I like to see my images all the way from the viewfinder to the final print to send to you.   This special size has the title and number etc printed in the lower border and will be signed on the back\r\n\r\nThis will is also available as a larger mounted print see . \r\n http://www.etsy.com/listing/79731299/horses-of-the-camargue-spray-edition\r\n\r\nOf course, the Copyright WATERMARK is for the web only and will not be on your print.\r\nNB The colour in image 1 is true to the print.\r\n\r\nMonitors do vary in the way they show color.  Please allow for slight variations between what you see and the actual print.  If you calibrate your monitor regularly hopefully you will see the best representation of the image.",

For times when you just need to let your mane fly!!!\r\n\r\nCreated of solid sterling silver. I&#39;ve sketched this beast in motion, hand sawn and imbued with a flash of 14k gold with a highly texturized surface that sparkles in the sun. Lastly it was given an antiqued patina and a brushed finish. Each one comes out differently in a really awesome ooak way. Frankly, these are one of my most favorite pieces... nothing cutesy here.

"title": "CAMARGUE HORSE - HERCULES, Pair of white horses, water, nautical equine, neutral, wall decor",
"description": "The White Horses of the Camargue live in a unique corner of South Western France. They are free-living amongst the fields and lagoons of a wildlife rich area.\r\n\r\nI named this horse Hercules in my mind as he was the largest Camargue Horse I saw and he was the Stallion of the group. The ladies and youngsters ran ahead and he just strolled in later at his own time. The mares usually waited for him on the bank of the lagoon and then frolicked off flirtily as soon as he arrived. On the one occasion they didn&#39;t, he snorted and then kicked his heels and just flew after them, disappearing in a cloud of dust. This image also shows one young filly who chose to walk with him. I love the contrast between the two and that she is hidden, you can just see her eyes as she follows along. This was another early morning shot with etheric light producing soft neutral tones.\r\n\r\nThis is a photographic print from an edition of 10 at this size.\r\nThe print is on A5 photo pro paper with a a small white border as illustrated.\r\nPaper size is 8 1/4 x 5 7/8 ins / 210 x148 mm\r\nPrint size is 7 1/2 x 4 7/8 ins / 193 x 123 mm\r\nImages are printed on Canon semi-gloss paper with Chromalife 100+ inks, for pure depth of colour and long life.\r\n\r\nThis image is also available in a larger size here :\r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/80183116/hercules-camargue-stallion-and-follower?ref=shop_home_active_4\r\n\r\nI print all my photographs myself, as I like to see my images all the way from the viewfinder to the final print to send to you.   This special size has the title and number etc printed in the lower border and will be signed on the back\r\n\r\nThis will is also available as a larger mounted print see . \r\n http://www.etsy.com/listing/79731299/horses-of-the-camargue-spray-edition\r\n\r\nOf course, the Copyright WATERMARK is for the web only and will not be on your print.\r\nNB The colour in image 1 is true to the print.\r\n\r\nMonitors do vary in the way they show color.  Please allow for slight variations between what you see and the actual print.  If you calibrate your monitor regularly hopefully you will see the best representation of the image.",

"description": "The Sculpture was sculpted and hand painted by shop owner.  This sculpture was originally sculpted in clay and cast in bronze, but this series is cast in a gypsum mineral stone and handpainted a dun color of a Kiger Mustang stallion and mounted on a stone or a wood base.  The proud arched neck and typish head has the look of a variety of breeds.  Can be painted to match your horse&#39;s color (need photos) or any color of your choice.  It measures; approx. overall height is 11.5 &quot; from bottom base to tips of ears.  The sculpture is 6 1/2 &quot; and the wood base is 6&quot; X 6&quot; square by 5&quot; tall. The stone mount show in photos will vary in shape and color as I found them. Wood base would be best. I used some photos of it cast in bronze. The bronze would sell for a higher price of $1,200.00. A deposit would have to be paid before the casting process would begin and could possibly take up to 3 months.  Any questions, please contact me and thank you so much for looking.",

After this step is finished then it will be sent to a foundry where another mother mold is made, then cast in bronze.  Cleaning up all imperfections, welding, patina and then a wood base is made and the bronze is mounted to base.  Other items in my shop are custom orders for  gypsum mineral stone sculptures, custom pet portrait mosaics, and embellished horseshoes are all welcome.  A couple of photos of your pet, showing as much of their personality and color as possible for the pet portraits, color choice or photo of your favorite horse for the stone sculpture and color choices for the horseshoe embellishments are all I need to create a one-of-a-kind work of art especially for you.",

Most prints will fit a standard frame (some will show a little of the white border) while others may require proper framing.  \r\n\r\nA little tip:  Many  photofinishers/camera stores that sell pre-made frames will trim a standard matt for you to fit your image.\r\n\r\nSHOP POLICIES- Please read my shop policies prior to purchase\r\n\r\nIf you would like to know more about me, please check out the following:\r\n\r\nWebsite:\r\nwww.janethillstudio.com \r\nBlog:\r\n www.janethillstudio.com/blog\r\nFacebook:\r\nhttp://www.facebook.com/JanetHillStudio\r\nInstagram:\r\nhttp://instagram.com/janethillstudio\r\n\r\nAll images are copyright of Janet Hill 2014.",

"description": "This heart shaped stained glass ornament has an Amish Harness Horse Head as the center.  I source these Amish Harness decorations from Harness shops in Holmes County, Ohio.

A perfect gift for any horse lover and can be used as a suncatcher all year.  These are 3 1/4 &quot;  x 3&quot; in size.\r\n\r\nOrders for specific colors will take 5 - 7 days to complete.
